# Features
- Automated conversation downloads from Intercom
- Batch processing (default: 100 conversations per batch)
- Automatic ZIP compression of batches
- Robust error handling with retries and logs
- Simple Excel-based input for URLs
- Progress bar and ETA calculation

# Requirements
- Python â‰¥ 3.8
- Chrome browser
- Dependencies (install via pip):

```bash
pip install playwright pandas openpyxl
playwright install chromium
```

# Usage
Prepare your Excel file:
Create an Excel file named links.xlsx.
Add a sheet named convos.
Place all conversation URLs in a column labeled url.
Launch Chrome with remote debugging: `chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222`
Run the script: `python intercom_dump.py`

The downloaded conversations are stored in the downloads folder, compressed into ZIP files (batch_XXX.zip).
